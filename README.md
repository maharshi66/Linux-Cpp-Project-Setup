# Linux-Cpp-Project-Setup
This repository consists of a comprehensive folder structure with a source-code/scripts for inter-process communication, Doxygen source-code documentation, Catch2 Unit Testing, Gcov/Lcov Code-Coverage Analysis and, multi-level Makefiles. This project is intended for setting up C/C++ projects on Linux.     

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
This project is meant to act as a template for any programmer who wants to build a C/C++ application from the ground-up. This template includes the following features that any Linux based C/C++ project might require:

####Inter-Process Communication (POSIX)
####Doxygen Source Code Documentation
####CCCC (C and C++ Code Counter)
####CppCheck (Static Tool Analysis)
####Catch2 Unit Tests

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
